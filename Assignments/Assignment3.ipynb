    "Extend the Dutch Flag Problem from the lecture to 3 colours. i.e. given a list of strings, each of which is either 'red', 'white', or 'blue' (each is repeated several times in the list), rearrange the list so that the strings are in the order of the Dutch national flagâ€”all the 'red' strings first, then all the 'white' strings, then all the 'blue' strings. Write a function called dutch_flag that takes a list and solves this problem.\n",
    "Generate random lists for n = 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000 and test your function with these lists. Plot a graph of running times using matplotlib. Your graph should be a line. i.e. the Dutch Flag algorithm shown has O(n) running time\n",
